# Simple tip calc

This is just a little CLI utility I wrote for day one of a class. It really 
doesn't have much utility outside that class, but I did
get to play with the Symfony Console component quite a bit. 

## Usage 

Clone the repo, cd into it, and run `./tip calculate`. This will give you
and interactive prompt. Supply an amount and desired tip percentage to get the proper
tip printed back to you.

Optionally, run `./tip calculate <amount>` to get a handy table with common tip amounts.

Really, I'm only liable to accept pull requests that would make this run a giant robot
which destroys Tokyo.
